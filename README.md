# Garmin Chinese Watchface

View the time in Chinese, great for students!

## About

This is a branch of a [garmin-mandarin-clock](https://github.com/starryalley/garmin-mandarin-clock) by [Mark Kuo](https://github.com/starryalley).
I love using this watch face, but felt it could use a little motion and decoration.
To make the watch feel a more alive, I've added second hand.
Inspired by how dive watches often have wave backgrounds, 
I've also added a decorative wave background meant to resemble the way clouds are frequently drawn in Asia.
