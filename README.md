# Garmin Chinese Watchface

View the time in Chinese, great for students! Available on Garmin ConnectIQ soon!

## About

This is a branch of [garmin-mandarin-clock](https://github.com/starryalley/garmin-mandarin-clock) by [Mark Kuo](https://github.com/starryalley).
I love using this watch face, and wanted to give it a little decoration and some motion.
Inspired by how dive watches often have wave backgrounds, 
I added a wave background of my own, meant to resemble the way clouds are often drawn in Asia.
I've also added a secondhand to make the watch feel more alive.
