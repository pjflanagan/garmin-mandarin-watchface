# Garmin Mandarin Watchface

This is a branch of a Chinese watch face by Mark Kuo. I felt the watchface needed a little decoration and motion.
I've added a second hand and a decorative background meant to resemble how dive watches often have wave backgrounds.
These waves were inspired by the way clouds are frequently drawn in Asia.
